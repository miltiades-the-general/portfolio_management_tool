# Risk Return Analysis
----

## About
This application is used to evaluate 4 major portfolio managers: Berkshire Hathaway INC, Tiger Management LLC, Soros Fund Management LLC and Paulson and Co. LLC. The first part analyzes the return performance of the various portfolios, the second part analyzes the volatility of the portfolios as well as the risk return profile of the portfolios. Finally, the portfolios can be assessed for diversification based on the results of their risk-return profiles. We choose our best performing portfolio based on the beta values as well as the Sharpe ratios. The beta value will tell us the volatility of the basket compared with the broader market, and the Sharpe ratios will tell us the return per unit of stress or risk for the assets in question. 

## Best Practices 
* The application will be run in Jupyter Lab Notebook as each area of assessment can be compartmentalized and evaluated in a linear order. Each component can be visualized using the matplotlib visualization library.
